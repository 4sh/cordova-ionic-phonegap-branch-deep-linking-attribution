The Cordova SDK shares the same code base as the Branch Web SDK, and includes functions to call all of the same API endpoints.

To use the Cordova SDK, you'll need to first initialize it with your Branch Key found in your [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings). You'll also need to register when your users login with `setIdentity`, and when they logout with `logout`.
